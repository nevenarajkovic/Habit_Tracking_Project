# Habit Tracking with Pixela

This project is a Python-based habit tracker that uses the Pixela API to log and visualize daily cycling distance.

The goal of this project is to practice working with APIs, HTTP requests (POST, PUT, DELETE), and handling dates in Python.

---

## Features

- Create a Pixela user and graph
- Add a daily activity entry (pixel)
- Update an existing pixel
- Delete a pixel
- Visualize progress through a Pixela graph

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Requests library
- Pixela API

---

## How It Works

Each day, the user enters how many kilometers they cycled.
That value is sent to the Pixela API and displayed as a pixel on a graph.

The project demonstrates:
- API authentication using headers
- Working with REST endpoints
- Formatting dates for API requests
